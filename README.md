# Skin Lesion Detection using CNN
## Overview
This project offers an end-to-end solution for instant skin lesion predictions while prioritizing user privacy. Leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly MobileNet CNN architecture, the system efficiently classifies skin lesions. Additionally, it's deployed with Tensorflow.js, ensuring quick and privacy-focused medical diagnostics.

## Key Features
- Tuned MobileNet CNN for efficient skin lesion classification.
- Prioritized user privacy throughout the development process.
- Deployed model with Tensorflow.js for rapid, privacy-focused medical tool.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tensorflow
- Tensorflow.js
- MobileNet

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Train or fine-tune the MobileNet CNN model using your skin lesion dataset.
3. Export the trained model to TensorFlow.js format for web deployment.
4. Integrate the model into your desired application, ensuring user privacy is maintained throughout the process.

## Privacy Considerations
- Ensure that all user data is handled securely and anonymized where possible.
- Implement encryption protocols for any data transmitted between client and server.
- Regularly audit the system for any potential privacy vulnerabilities.
